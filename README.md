# cgpa
This is a terminal based app that stores the details of 
students along with their SGPAs in each semester, which in turn 
calculates and displays the CGPA of the student. It allows users to 
perform various operations such as inserting new student data in a 
sorted linked list, deleting existing student records, updating 
student details, searching for students by roll number, displaying 
top students based on CGPA, and displaying all student records.
